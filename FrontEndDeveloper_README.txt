-------------------------
Frontend.java- creates the user interface to call the Backend and find/retrieve pokemon in an organized manner
FrontEndDeveloperTests.java - tests the working properties of Frontend.java
 


Additional Contributions:
-------------------------
I helped the backend with determining his Interface methods, as well as comunnicated back and forth 
with the Red team to help them as well. The frontend developer for the Red team had dropped the class
so I was in charge of ensuring the frontend worked for their program as well as helping the Red backend
developer create and implement the interface.
